# Squirrel Tracker: Django-based visualization for squirrel sightings


# Project Introduction

We created a **Squirrel Tracker** using *Django* to import, export associated data about and provide visualization for sightings of squirrels found in Central Park, New York.


# Data Source
In this project,we have used the [*2018 Central Park Squirrel Census*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw) dataset published by [*Squirrel Census*](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/).This data set contains information pertaining to the number of sightings, including location coordinates, age, physical features and so on. 


# Management Commands 
Import: is a command that can import the data from the csv file, 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census. Specifically, the file path should be included after the management command in the command line. 

```sh
python manage.py import_squirrel_data /path/to/file.csv
```

Export: is a command that can be used to export the data in a CSV format. Also, the file path should be added at the command line after the management command.

```sh
python manage.py export_squirrel_data /path/to/file.csv
```
